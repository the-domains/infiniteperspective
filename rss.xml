            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Here comes the boom</h1><p> When photographer Iwan Zwarts was in South Africa recently, he was able to frame shots like never before. Instead of wandering around for hours, looking to set up his tripod and frame the landscape for a unique composition, he was now getting shots that would’ve been impossible before in a fraction of the time.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0a4dd8d41a1f0f0d7c9856d861ae908edf4e9552.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>SEND IN THE DRONES</h1><p>Both Zwarts and Kneale see it as just a matter of time before drones become ubiquitous. "We’re on the verge of a boom much like the GoPro," says Zwarts. "You’ll just see it more and more, in movies, commercials, everywhere. The application possibilities are phenomenal."

Kneale agrees that a boom is imminent and takes his prediction one step further. "It’s coming," says Kneale. "I guarantee the Christmas after next it will be the hot gift for everyone. Then everyone will get pissed off. It will be a social experiment."</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/546af957d4ecdb901ee140bf81f80a42212311c1.jpg"></article>]]></description>
