Whether it's advertising or your next summer vacation video, drone photography is set to change how you see everything.

As with all new technology, Zwarts says UAV photography's biggest strengths are realized when combined with tried and true fundamentals. "There are loads of people trying it out and taking aerial shots, but it's about using that freedom while staying grounded in good composition and other creative foundations," says Zwarts. "It's like when digital cameras became readily available. You have millions of more photos, but are they better? It's about sticking to the artistic interpretation while using the new tools." 

For Zwarts, the perfect drone shot starts close on someone indoors, with the camera pulling out, maybe through a window, and into a wider shot. "Before we'd have to shoot it in sections, with all kinds of technical limitations and then stitch it together in post," he says. "Now we can shoot that in one take with a drone."
